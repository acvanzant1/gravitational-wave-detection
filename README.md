**Gravitational Wave Detection Using Deep Learning**

**Overview**

This project investigates the use of deep learning for the real-time classification of gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Two architectures are explored and compared:
	â€¢	A high-capacity 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)
	â€¢	A parameter-efficient Residual Network (ResNet)

Both models are implemented and trained entirely on Apple Silicon (M2 Max) hardware using public strain data from the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC). The goal is to evaluate their performance in real LIGO noise environments while ensuring portability to consumer-grade, non-GPU systems.

**Key Contributions**
	â€¢	Fully local training and inference: No cloud services or NVIDIA GPUs were used.
	â€¢	Model benchmarking on Apple Silicon: Demonstrates strong classification performance with minimal resource overhead.
	â€¢	Open and reproducible pipeline: All data and models are derived from open-source APIs and tools such as GWPy, PyCBC, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
	â€¢	Perfect classification results: Both models achieved 100% precision, recall, and F1-score on test data under current settings.
	â€¢	Realistic preprocessing: Includes whitening, bandpass filtering, and injection of SEOBNRv2 waveforms into both Gaussian and PSD-shaped synthetic noise.

**Hardware & Software**
	â€¢	Platform: Apple Mac Studio (M2 Max, 32 GB RAM)
	â€¢	Python version: 3.9.9
	â€¢	Frameworks: TensorFlow (Metal), PyTorch (MPS), GWPy, PyCBC
	â€¢	Runtime:
	â€¢	1D-CNN: ~10.5 min
	â€¢	ResNet: ~25 min

**Getting Started**

This paper outlines the development, training, and evaluation of both 1D-CNN and ResNet architectures for classifying gravitational wave signals in realistic LIGO noise, with full compatibility on Apple Silicon hardware.

Note, the thesis followed a structural protocol found on the syllabus - it may contain unconventional subsections, but overall this thesis satisifed the necessary requirments for me to graduate.
